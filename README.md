Hello I'am @TejasChaudhari 
I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and TeleCommunication Branch, with a strong foundation in programming, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering.
Proficient in multiple programming languages including Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL, I have developed a range of projects that showcase my skills. 
My expertise in databases is backed by hands-on experience with MySQL Workbench. 
In addition to academic pursuits, I am deeply interested in operating systems (OS) and database management systems (DBMS). 
I actively engage in problem-solving on platforms like Leetcode and GeeksForGeeks to sharpen my skills and stay updated with the latest industry trends.
I am eager to contribute to innovative projects and collaborate with like-minded individuals to create impactful software solutions.
